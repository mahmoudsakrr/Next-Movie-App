# Movie App

Welcome to the **Movie App**, a web application that allows you to explore movies and TV shows from the ODMb API database. With this app, you can search for any movie, add it to your favorites, and manage your favorites list by removing movies and also navigate between light and dark modes.

 
## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Routing for Movie Details Pages**  
  Each movie has its own dedicated page using **Next.js dynamic routing**, enabling easy navigation and displaying detailed information for each movie.

- **Custom Fetch Wrapper**  
  A custom **fetch wrapper** around the native `fetch()` API is designed to be more powerful and flexible, handling both **server-side** and **client-side** fetches efficiently in **Next.js** applications.
  
- **Search Movies**  
  Search any movie using data fetched from the **OMDb API**.

- **Favorites Management (with Zustand + localStorage)**  
  - Add or remove movies from your favorites list.    
  - Favorites are **persisted in localStorage**, so they remain saved even after page reloads.  

- **Responsive UI with Burger Menu**  
  Fully responsive design with a mobile-friendly **burger menu** for intuitive navigation.

- **Dark and Light Modes**  
  Seamless theme switching between light and dark modes, giving users control over their preferred look and **persisted in localStorage**.

- **Styled with SCSS**  
  Custom styles are crafted using **SCSS** for modular, maintainable, and scalable styling.

- **Aliased Imports**  
  Clean and simplified import paths using **Next.js alias configuration** (`@/components`, `@/state`, etc.).

- **Conditional Rendering**  
  Hides the default movie list when search results are available for a cleaner interface.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
  Uses **Next.js SSR** to improve performance and SEO.

- **CI/CD & Deployment**  
  Deployed on **Vercel** with **CI/CD** integration for automatic updates via GitHub.
